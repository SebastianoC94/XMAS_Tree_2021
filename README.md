# XMAS_Tree_2021
The XMAS Tree 2021 project circuit board has an STM8L101F2P3 and 7 LEDs.
The LEDs are used to simulate a small Christmas tree. 
# Why these components?
The main constraint of the design is to minimize the power consumption of the entire circuit.
This choice stems from the fact that the device is powered by commercial batteries and needs to be able to operate for as long as possible. 
More detailed power consumption analysis will be conducted in the future. 

It was therefore chosen to use a microcontroller classified suitable for low power applications: STM8L.
